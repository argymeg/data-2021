description: Stirlingshire Voluntary Enterprise have organised this Hustings to give
  third sector organisation representatives the opportunity to have their say, meet
  with local candidates, and exchange ideas. The discussions over an hour and a half,
  will hopefully help you to make an informed decision about where individual votes
  are going, and better understand candidates position on issues key to the third
  sector.
