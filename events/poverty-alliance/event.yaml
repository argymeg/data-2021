description: "The 2021 Scottish Parliament elections come at a critical juncture for\
  \ tackling poverty in Scotland. With the pandemic having pulled ever-greater numbers\
  \ of people into poverty, the next Scottish Parliament will be required to take\
  \ more action to boost incomes, reduce the cost of living, and loosen the grip of\
  \ poverty on people's lives.\r\n\r\nThis event, taking place 5.30pm - 7pm on Tuesday\
  \ 6th April, will be chaired by Fiona Garven (Director, SCDC) and will bring together\
  \ representatives from Scotland's political parties to set out their parties' plans\
  \ for tackling poverty in the coming years. "
