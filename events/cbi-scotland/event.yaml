description: "Putting the economy at the centre of the debate\r\n\r\nWith the Holyrood\
  \ election fast approaching and being described by many as the most important since\
  \ devolution, CBI Scotland is partnering with ScottishPower to host a debate on\
  \ the key challenges and opportunities facing Scotland\u2019s economy.\r\n\r\nFrom\
  \ rebuilding the economy from the devastating impact of the pandemic, to tackling\
  \ the climate crisis and reskilling our workforce for the jobs of the future, there\
  \ has never been a more important time to ensure the business voice is heard at\
  \ Holyrood.\r\n\r\nThe economy-focussed hustings will give you the opportunity to\
  \ hear senior representatives from all of Holyrood\u2019s main parties outline their\
  \ vision for the future of the Scottish economy. There will also be a chance to\
  \ ask questions and raise key business priorities. Representatives from the media\
  \ will also be invited to attend. "
