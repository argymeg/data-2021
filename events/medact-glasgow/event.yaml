description: "As the host of the COP26 climate talks this November, the city of Glasgow\
  \ will be at the centre of a global discussion concerning the health of people and\
  \ planet. It is crucial that we take this opportunity to promote a vision of a post-COVID\
  \ recovery that both tackles the climate crisis and supports those most impacted\
  \ by the crises we face.\r\n\r\nJoin us on international Earth Day for our special\
  \ election hustings, as healthcare workers in Glasgow grill candidates in the upcoming\
  \ Scottish elections on their plans for a just and green recovery post-COVID!"
