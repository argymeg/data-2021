description: 'Hustings-style event (free) organised by Glasgow UBI Conversation.
  Glasgow-focused, although the issues are national.
  Panellists (all candidates in Glasgow) will make initial 3-minute statements on
  their views on Universal Basic Income and then being subjected to questions from
  the online audience during the remainder of the 2 hours. Focus is on Universal Basic
  Income, and whether and how it can solve problems such as poverty, debt, use of
  food banks, the low-wage gig economy, the stigma and other problems associated with
  the current benefits system, people in abusive relationships, young people feeling
  abandoned by society and migrants with no access to public funds.      '
