description: "Last summer we saw unprecedented pressure of visitors seeking to enjoy\
  \ Scotland\u2019s countryside. Sadly, that pressure was made more acute by the damaging\
  \ behaviour of a minority, ranging from simple ignorance of responsible access to\
  \ blatant criminality.\r\n\r\nAs the country prepares to emerge from lockdown again,\
  \ there is an urgent need to be better prepared for the months ahead.\r\n\r\nThese\
  \ immediate challenges are not temporary. We need to face the fact that parts of\
  \ Scotland don\u2019t have the infrastructure to cope with the demands we put upon\
  \ them in normal times. Tourism brings huge economic benefits to Scotland, so longer-term\
  \ solutions need to be found. But those solutions should not endanger our hard-won\
  \ access rights. \r\n\r\nIn the search for answers, ScotWays, on behalf of the Scottish\
  \ Outdoor Recreation Alliance, is hosting a major Holyrood Election Hustings at\
  \ lunchtime on April 16th. We will pose some provocative questions to the panel\
  \ of politicians and try to forge a path ahead."
