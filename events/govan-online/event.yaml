description: "The election on 6th May 2021 comes at the end of a Parliament like no\
  \ other and just as world leaders join the road to Glasgow, where they'll plan to\
  \ save the planet and forge a new, net zero economy at COP26. People and communities\
  \ across Scotland are blethering about building back a better, fairer society, from\
  \ a pandemic that has magnified the life limiting inequalities, vulnerabilities\
  \ and poverty that persists in post-industrial Govan. All in the shadow of mounting\
  \ debt and deficits.\r\n\r\nWe invite Candidates from Scotland\u2019s main political\
  \ parties to explore how their manifesto pledges and priorities for the next Scottish\
  \ Parliament will change Govan and improve the lives and lived experience of the\
  \ people who call it home.\r\n\r\nJOBS - EDUCATION - HEALTH - ECONOMY - HOUSING\
  \ - ENVIRONMENT - CRIME"
