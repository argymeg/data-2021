description: 'The event will be an opportunity for RCGP Scotland members to hear from
  representatives of the major political parties in Scotland on their priorities for
  general practice and healthcare in the forthcoming Scottish Parliament elections.
  Attendees will also have the opportunity to submit questions to candidates in advance
  of the event on issues relating to general practice. This promises to be a lively
  event, which will provide an insight on political priorities for general practice
  over the coming years and will help to raise the profile of general practice to
  political parties as we enter into the 2021 Scottish Parliamentary elections. '
