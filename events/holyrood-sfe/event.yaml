description: "Scotland is home to one of Europe\u2019s leading financial services\
  \ centres. As a result of its highly adaptable and skilled workforce, a number of\
  \ global companies have invested in Scotland and created jobs.\r\n\r\nScotland also\
  \ has a competitive advantage in energy production and natural capital, and with\
  \ COP26 being in held in Glasgow this year, 2021 will be a pivotal year for green\
  \ finance in Scotland.\r\n\r\nAs we emerge from the pandemic and adjust to life\
  \ outside of the EU, Scotland\u2019s financial sector has a vital role in achieving\
  \ a fair, green and inclusive recovery.\r\n\r\nJoin Holyrood and SFE as we discuss\
  \ the challenges in the future, particularly climate change, but also opportunities\
  \ for the sector to make a positive impact on society with representatives from\
  \ across the political spectrum."
