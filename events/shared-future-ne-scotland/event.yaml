  \ such as refugees and some prisoners will have the right to vote for the first\
  \ time in a Scottish Parliamentary Election.\r\n\r\nIn advance of the election,\
  \ Shared Futures have invited candidates from the major political parties to join\
  \ the panel at a hustings event on Tuesday, 20th April. Panel members will be announced\
  \ in mid-April.\r\n\r\nThe panel will be taking questions from local community groups\
  \ on equality issues impacting the North East that are key to Shared Futures' work,\
  \ namely: Brexit, Gypsy/Travellers, New Scots & refugees in the Aegean Islands,\
  \ and No Recourse to Public Funds. "
