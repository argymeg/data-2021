  \ and social care system in recent history.\r\n\r\nAs we approach the 2021 Scottish\
  \ Parliamentary elections, now is an ideal opportunity to think about what we want\
  \ from our health and care system moving forward; how the challenges around recruitment\
  \ and retention can be addressed; and how we can ensure staff are appropriately\
  \ valued, protected and supported.\r\n\r\nJoin Holyrood and the BMA Scotland\u2019\
  s Health Hustings on 19th April to discuss these issues and more. Hear from representatives\
  \ from each party on the steps they believe need to be taken to ensure a recovery\
  \ that works for staff and patients alike.  "
