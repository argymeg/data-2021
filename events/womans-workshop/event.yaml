description: As campaigning moves online there are plenty of opportunities for women
  to get involved from the comfort of your own home.  This workshop is a space for
  you to learn more about everything that happens in an election campaign and the
  various ways that you can get involved as an active citizen.    Hustings are an
  excellent opportunity to challenge all of the candidates in your area about the
  issues that are important to you. We are going to explain how it all works and empower
  you to participate. By logging in and raising questions you can shift the narrative
  of politics in your area.
